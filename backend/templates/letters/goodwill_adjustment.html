<p>I am writing to request a goodwill adjustment to my credit report regarding the account referenced above.</p>

<p>I have been a loyal customer and I take my credit obligations seriously. However, due to circumstances beyond my control, I experienced a temporary hardship that resulted in the late payment(s) appearing on my credit report.</p>

<h2>Explanation of Circumstances</h2>
{% if dispute.narrative %}
<p>{{ dispute.narrative }}</p>
{% else %}
<p>[Please see attached documentation explaining the circumstances that led to the late payment(s).]</p>
{% endif %}

<h2>My Credit History</h2>
<p>I would like to highlight the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prior to this incident, I maintained a positive payment history with your company</li>
    <li>Since the incident, I have resumed regular on-time payments</li>
    <li>This was an isolated occurrence, not a pattern of behavior</li>
    <li>I have taken steps to ensure this situation does not recur</li>
</ul>

<h2>Request for Goodwill Adjustment</h2>
<p>I am respectfully requesting that you consider removing the late payment notation(s) from my credit report as a goodwill gesture. This negative mark is significantly impacting my credit score and my ability to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Qualify for favorable interest rates</li>
    <li>Obtain housing</li>
    <li>Achieve my financial goals</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand that you are not legally obligated to make this adjustment, and I truly appreciate your consideration of this request. A positive response would demonstrate your company's commitment to customer relationships and would be greatly appreciated.</p>

{% block closing %}
<p>Thank you for taking the time to review my request. I have attached supporting documentation for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response and to continuing our business relationship.</p>

    <li>Copy of government-issued identification</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a voluntary goodwill request and not a formal dispute under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p>
