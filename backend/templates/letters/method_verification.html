<p>I am writing to request the method of verification used to confirm the accuracy of information appearing on my credit report, pursuant to Section 611(a)(7) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).</p>

<p>I previously disputed this account, and you reported that it was "verified" as accurate. Under the FCRA, I am entitled to know the specific procedure and method used to verify this information.</p>

<h2>Required Disclosure</h2>
<p>Under Section 611(a)(7) of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. Section 1681i(a)(7)), upon request, you must provide to me:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information</li>
    <li>The business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information</li>
    <li>The telephone number of such furnisher, if reasonably available</li>
</ol>

<h2>Specific Information Requested</h2>
<p>Please provide the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The name, address, and telephone number of the person or entity you contacted to verify this account</li>
    <li>A detailed description of the verification procedure used</li>
    <li>The specific documents or records reviewed during the verification process</li>

<p>Please note that simply reporting that the account was "verified" without actually conducting a meaningful investigation does not satisfy the requirements of the FCRA. I request specific, detailed information about your verification procedures.</p>

{% block closing %}
<p>Please provide the requested method of verification information within 15 days. If you are unable to provide this information, it may indicate that a proper investigation was not conducted, and I reserve the right to pursue all available legal remedies.</p>
